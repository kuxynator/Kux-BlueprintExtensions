# Kuxynator's Blueprint Extensions

*This is a republishing of the fabulous mod [Blueprint Extensions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BlueprintExtensions).*

> Even if the name suggests it, it is not "my" Blueprint Extensions ;-) 
The correct name would be *"Kuxynator's continued and extended version of Blueprint Extensions"*, 
But that would be much too long. Most of the code was written by my predecessors, they deserve the honor.
