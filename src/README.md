# Kuxynator's Blueprint Extensions

*This is a republish of the fabulous mod [Blueprint Extensions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BlueprintExtensions).*

This new version 1.0.0: 
- supports Factorio 1.0 and 
- contains a fix for the crash on selecting a blueprint book
- repairs blueprint allignment (Num 1..9) (not jet perfect but better as nothing)
- still in development but useable

Based on Blueprint Extensions 0.5.0 
Old issues except the above mentioned still exist. I will look what I can do. Suggestions are welcome.
